ActionMailerTls
===============

Use GMail SMTP server to send emails in Rails ActionMailer

Example
=======

Put this in config/initializers/mail.rb:

    ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
      :address => "smtp.gmail.com",
      :port => 587,
      :domain => "mycompany.com",
      :authentication => :plain,
      :user_name => "username@mycompany.com",
      :password => "password"
    }

Or better yet, keep your password outside of version control in a configuration YAML file (http://railscasts.com/episodes/85-yaml-configuration-file) like

    development:
      smtp_settings:
        address: smtp.gmail.com
        port: 587
        authentication: :plain
        ...

and just do

    ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = APP_CONFIG['smtp_settings'].symbolize_keys
